After my previous [blog article](./wazuh-devenv), I received feedback that it is good at providing a high-level perspective but lacks the bottom-up approach of technical implementations. Therefore, I decided to write a how-to guide dedicated to writing behavioral tests for Wazuh. In this article, we will walk through the steps one by one to install and set up the development environment on WSL[^1] and then write our first tests. I will try to do a walkthrough, but I'll add context whenever I can.

**Full disclosure:** I developed `wazuh-devenv`, `wazuhevtx`, and `wazuh-testgen` because I kept running into the same testing challenges in my own work. They’re open-source, built for my workflow, and may not be the only way to achieve these results. This article is more like "my way" of implementing Detectio-as-Code. Feel free to adapt the concepts here using your own tools or methods—what matters is making detection testing repeatable and reliable.

## Setting up the environment

Here’s a narrative version with the same voice and glossary, no numbered steps:

I’m assuming you’ve already got your favorite Python IDE handy; I’ll use VS Code here because it plays nicely with WSL and lets me keep everything inside Windows while coding against Linux. First things first: make sure WSL itself is installed. If it isn’t, open an elevated terminal and run `wsl --install`, then reboot when Windows asks. Once WSL is available, pick the Linux distro that best mirrors your production environment so your tests behave the same way. You can see what’s officially supported at the moment by asking WSL to list them:

```ini
wsl.exe --list --online
The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.
Install using 'wsl.exe --install <Distro>'.

NAME                            FRIENDLY NAME

OracleLinux_8_10                Oracle Linux 8.10
OracleLinux_9_5                 Oracle Linux 9.5
```

For this walkthrough I’ll stick with Ubuntu LTS, so I’ll install it with `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`.

{% include gallery id="galleryWslInstall" caption="WSL first install screen" %}

Before spinning up Wazuh, I like to cap WSL’s resource usage so it doesn’t swallow my RAM. Create or edit `~/.wslconfig` and drop in a sane default:

```ini
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 8 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=8GB 

# Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
processors=2
```

Tune those values for your workstation, then launch your distro (`wsl` from PowerShell/cmd is fine). On first run, set your username and password, and immediately bring the box up to date. In a fresh Ubuntu, I’ll do:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt autoremove -y
```

With the base ready, I clone the development environment directly into my home so paths are simple:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/zbalkan/wazuh-devenv.git
cd wazuh-devenv
ls
```

{% include gallery id="galleryGitLs" caption="Inside the repository" %}

From here, `code .` launches VS Code rooted in the repo so we can keep iterating in one place.

{% include gallery id="galleryVscode" caption="VS Code first view" %}

To bootstrap everything, I run `sudo ./install.sh`. The installer is idempotent and distro-aware; it also asks whether you want to copy any existing custom rules. Under the hood, the dev env swaps out the default `/var/ossec/etc/rules` and `/var/ossec/etc/decoders` for paths mounted from the repo so versioning and sync are painless. The trade-off is permissions—you may need to fix a few file modes after the switch. When the prompt appears, copy your rules/decoders if you have them, hit `y`, and continue.

{% include gallery id="galleryVscodePrompt" caption="User is asked to copy custom rules and decoders, if any." %}

You’ll also be prompted for a username to add to the `wazuh` group; use your regular WSL user (not `root`) so file operations stay smooth. For a better debugging loop, I like to create a `.vscode` folder at the repo root and copy `sample.launch.json` into it as `launch.json`. Even though this project doesn’t depend on third-party Python packages, I still isolate with a virtualenv to keep my tooling clean. Once the installer finishes, the environment is ready and we can start treating detections as code—editing rules, replaying logs, and iterating without leaving VS Code.

## Writing your first tests

### Wazuh rules under the hood

Now, I do not plan to repeat myself with the previous example of the Fortinet rule. This time, I will use a more detailed approach. But first, I need to remind the reader of the architectural aspects of Wazuh detections.

Wazuh rules are like building blocks. Unlike other rule languages like Sigma or query languages like SPL or KQL, Wazuh rules are built on top of each other in a tree structure. Wazuh, at the core, is a stream processing engine, and the most important component is the `wazuh-analysisd` service. This service loads Wazuh rules and builds several tree-like structures of rules based on `<if_sid>`, `<if_group>`, `<if_matched_sid>`, or `<if_matched_group>`. If a rule does not have a parent, it will be used first. But if you add a **virtual root** as the ultimate parent, you would see a directed acyclic graph (DAG)[^2]. Hypothetically, you can consider this virtual root as the starting point to match the rules. So, this virtual root rule means `any log`. The `wazuh-analysisd` service then starts checking against first-level children—aka rules with no parent—to find at least a partial match. Then, after finding the first matching node, the log is evaluated against the child rules of that, and so on. Therefore, the logic can be summed up as `the most specific rule wins`—a useful mental model rather than a strict guarantee. This matching approach often **prunes the search space** instead of iterating over all rules. In the [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), you can think of it as **closer to `O(log N)` in well-structured trees**, though real-world cost depends on decoder outcomes, branching fan-out, and per-node checks (e.g., field comparisons, regex); in dense sibling sets it can **approach linear within a subtree**.

This unique design also has side effects: converting Sigma or some other detection language to Wazuh is not a one-to-one translation job. You must find a parent for a proper detection logic. While you can have rules without a parent, you would end up with independent nodes and basically break the tree/graph structure I mentioned above. In the long term, you'll face performance issues. However, while drafting your rule, that is still the first step. You start with a very specific rule, then find a suitable parent in the current ruleset. We will use this approach very soon.

{% include gallery id="galleryExplorer" caption="Wazuh default ruleset visualized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)" %}

In the graph above[^3], you can see the first-level rules, depicted as the children of the **virtual root** I created. It shows the rules with no parent rule. This is the starting point of every match. One of the great resources when detecting threats in Windows endpoints is the very noisy `Security/4688` [^4]. In the graph, you can see the parent-child relationship I have mentioned. In the reverse order, we can see these rules:

- 67027 - A process was created
- 60103 - Windows audit success event
- 60001 - Group of Windows rules for the security channel
- 60000 - Group of windows rules
- Our virtual root -meaning `any log`, something I created for a better comprehension.

{% include gallery id="galleryTree" caption="Wazuh rule `67027 - A process was created.` shown in the graph" %}

Now that we understand the way rules work, we can proceed with writing behavioral rules.

### Behavioral testing through log replay

The Wazuh rules are building blocks chained as tree or graph structures, as we mentioned in the previous paragraph. Therefore, testing single rules ensures that the engineer does not break the evaluation chain. This is the reason I called these tests [regression tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing): to ensure changes did not break previously functioning parts. But regression testing do not guarantee better detection coverage, that is the job of attack simulations. You can attack test devices or services and monitor the alerts. That way, we can ensure we are covering proper behavior-based detections in our environment. Refer to the [Emulation of ATT&CK techniques and detection with Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/blog/emulation-of-attck-techniques-and-detection-with-wazuh/) and [Adversary emulation with CALDERA and Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/blog/adversary-emulation-with-caldera-and-wazuh/) article by Wazuh team for testing defenses through attack simulation.

But this is an expensive approach: one behavior at a time and writing detections afterwards requires a high amount of time and human resources. Luckily, there's a middle ground: replaying logs! We can make use of public resources for logs that contain malicious behavior, run them against our test harness, `wazuh-devenv`, and check if we can detect the malicious behavior effectively. And this is exactly what I'll do here.

Let's start with an amazing resource, [EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack](https://github.com/mdecrevoisier/EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack) by [Michel de CREVOISIER](https://github.com/mdecrevoisier). The repository contains Windows event log samples mapped to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs that we can make use of.

{% include gallery id="galleryLogRepo" caption="EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack repository contains EVTX samples mapped to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs" %}

For educational purposes, I will check if we can detect Lateral Movement via Remote Desktop ([T1021.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/)) using the default rules. Inside the folder, there are three files:

- ID4688-4778 RDP hijack command execution.evtx
- ID4688,4778,4779 RDP hijack direct.evtx
- ID4825-Denied RDP connection with valid credentials.evtx

Let's analyze them manually before checking what kind of attacks we are expecting.

#### ID4688,4778,4779 RDP hijack direct.evtx

{% include gallery id="galleryTscon" caption="The lolbin tscon.exe is used to hijack RDP session" %}

In the Security log, three event IDs are most relevant to RDP session hijacking with tscon.exe. [Security/4688](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688) records new process creation, allowing us to trace attacker commands. Security/4778 shows a successful RDP session reconnection, while [Security/4779](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4779) records a session disconnection. We can then observe the [Security/4778](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4778) event, a reconnect event with same session name but different account name. Together, they let us reconstruct both the hijack execution and its impact on users.

Let's define our detection requirements after analyzing the timeline of events. We want Wazuh to alert us when these events were forwarded.

According to the Wazuh [rules classification guide](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/ruleset/rules/rules-classification.html), the highest level of an alert is level **15 - Severe attack**. In the logs above we can see that the hijack succeded, and there is no doubt that the alert must be precise. To help the comprehesion of the user, we must provide clear and rich alerts with proper MITRE ATT&CK TTP IDs. In my humble opinion, the best suited ones would be [T1021.001 - Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/), [T1563.002 - Remote Service Session Hijacking: RDP Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/002/), and [T1078 - Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

To satisfy the requirements above, we need to:

1. Ensure that there is a response for each log. This is to ensure the test data is not corrupted and does not break the analysis.
2. Ensure that there is an alert with level **15** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1021.001 - Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol*.
3. Ensure that there is an alert with level **15** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1563.002 - Remote Service Session Hijacking: RDP Hijacking*.
3. Ensure that there is an alert with level **15** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1078 - Valid Accounts*.

How we will implement the rule depends on us but these are the minimum set of behaviors we want to observe if we replay these logs.

#### ID4688-4778 RDP hijack command execution.evtx

The second log set shows activity from the Security event log, dominated by Security/4688 and a single Security/4778. While process creation is mostly informational, reconnect events are more relevant for detecting possible lateral movement or RDP hijacking.

We must align with the Wazuh rules classification guide once again. It is beter to pick level **13 - Unusual error (high importance)** here. It is worth an alert but we cannot be sure if the attack succeded, with lack of other indicators we had in the previous log. We must:

1. Ensure that there is a response for each log. This is to ensure the test data is not corrupted and does not break the analysis.
2. Ensure that there is an alert with level **13** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1021.001 - Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol*.
3. Ensure that there is an alert with level **13** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1563.002 - Remote Service Session Hijacking: RDP Hijacking*.
4. Ensure that there is an alert with level **13** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1078 - Valid Accounts*.

#### ID4825-Denied RDP connection with valid credentials.evtx

The logs in the last file do not depict an obvious [indicator of attack (IOA)](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/ioa-indicators-of-attack.html), but a medium-level helper that allows us to be informed by the denied authentication for RDP. The requirements are similar here.

1. Ensure that there is a response for each log. This is to ensure the test data is not corrupted and does not break the analysis.
2. Ensure that there is an alert with level **5** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1021.001 - Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol*.
3. Ensure that there is an alert with level **5** and has a MITRE ATT&CK TTP ID of *T1078 - Valid Accounts*.
4. Ensure that there is an alert with level **5** and has a group named *authentication_failed*.

Level 5 means "User generated error", according to the rules classification guide we used before. Since the denial of RDP connection is a denied access, we added a group check as well. They look like accurate levels for these events.

#### Test generation

But we cannot use the EVTX files in our test environment. The `wazuh-devenv` tests expect logs as plain strings. We need to convert EVTX files to text that Wazuh can use. In a previous article, [Enhancing Wazuh Rule Testing with wazuhevtx: A Solution for Windows Event Logs](https://zaferbalkan.com/wazuhevtx/), I mentioned a tool I developed called [wazuhevtx](https://github.com/zbalkan/wazuhevtx) that works on Windows to convert EVTX files to JSONL-formatted logs, the same way Wazuh agent converts. We can just run `pip install wazuhevtx` or `pipx install wazuhevtx` and copy the generated logs as our test data.

{% include gallery id="galleryWazuhevtx" caption="You can use pip or pipx to download wazuhevtx tool" %}

But now, we'll use a helper to speed up the process by using a test generator that I simply called [wazuh-testgen](https://github.com/zbalkan/wazuh-testgen). This is a separate tool I created to support the `wazuh-devenv` project. Thanks to the `wazuhevtx` library, we can just provide an attack scenario, the directory of EVTX files, and the output files, and get a template for writing behavioral tests to start working on. The `evtx` subcommand of the `wazuh-testgen` imports the `wazuhevtx` library to convert the logs in memory and processes to generate test templates. Below, you can see the usage for the EVTX subcommand.

```bash
usage: generator.py evtx [-h] --scenario SCENARIO --input_dir INPUT_DIR --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --scenario, -s SCENARIO
                        Name for the tests to use for the generated tests.
  --input_dir, -i INPUT_DIR
                        Directory where input files are located.
  --output_dir, -o OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory where the Python test files will be saved.
```

For the sake of convenience, I copied the EVTX files into a folder called `input` under the `wazuh-testgen` project, and set the target folder as `output` in the same directory. By running the command `python src/generator.py evtx --scenario T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol --input_dir input/T1021.001-Remote Desktop Protocol --output_dir output/behavioral_tests`, I came up with the test template code below:

```python
import unittest

import internal.logtest as lt  # type: ignore


class TestT1021001RemoteDesktopProtocol(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_id4688_4778_4779_rdp_hijack_direct(self) -> None:

These are templates the generator created but the boilerplate code provides most of the examples we need.

#### Writing tests based on the requirements

If you remember [the previous post](https://zaferbalkan.com/wazuh-devenv/#workflow-overview), I mentioned the **Red, Green, Refactor** approach there. We are in the **Red** phase now: the tests fail, because we wrote the tests first, not the code. Now, our task is to satisfy the tests and make it green. However, the generated test above is a template. So, let's write our first tests and run them.

We will implement the requirements one by one in the tests.

```python
import unittest

import internal.logtest as lt


class TestT1021001RemoteDesktopProtocol(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_id4688_4778_4779_rdp_hijack_direct(self) -> None:

We defined our test cases in Python. In order to write an "at least one" rule, I used a Python `set` and checked for an `intersection` using the AND operation with `&`. The rule level check is more readable. Let's run our code without writing any rules.

{% include gallery id="galleryRed" caption="Unit tests failed, we are in Red state." %}

Unfortunately, the default ruleset of Wazuh does not satisfy the requirements. We must write custom rules. We are definitely in the `RED` state.

Let's define the first rule now. We must detect the `tscon` usage for RDP hijacking. Let's cheat a bit here and check what others do. We can only progress by standing on the shoulders of the giants. We have [a Sigma rule in the Sigma HQ repository](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_tscon_rdp_redirect.yml) exactly for this purpose.

We can summarize the detection conditions: In the process creation events (Security/4688), search for ` /dest:rdp-tcp#` in the command line field. This is exactly what we wanted, but not sufficient. In the first log sample, we have a more reliable indicator of the attack: the session disconnect/reconnect events with different accounts but same session name. We must cover that with a higher severity. Then, we can focus on the denied RDP connection in the last file. It is nothing but the Security/4825 - A user was denied the access to Remote Desktop. Let's write the rules now:

```xml
<group name="custom,windows,security,windows_security,">

```

After you created the rules, ensure the file permissions are correct. Run `./fix_permissions.sh` after you added the new rule file. Now, it is time to run the test once again. We are running the `preflight_tests` and `behavioral_tests`.

{% include gallery id="galleryGreen" caption="Unit tests succeeded, we are in Green state." %}

We reached the `GREEN` state. It is now up to the detection engineers to fine-tune the rules more for the `REFACTOR` phase. It is possible to add more groups and labels or suppress false positive cases. Our behavioral tests are now completed. We can now ensure that Wazuh can detect many of the Lateral Movement events via Remote Desktop. With more coverage, we improved our detection posture.

#### Future-proofing detections through regression testing

We can stop here, but I suggest moving one step further. I have mentioned that regression testing has a purpose: we do not break current functionality in future changes. Since we now have three new rules, we can write tests for these specifically to ensure we do not break them in future updates. If you remember the `wazuh-testgen` tool above, it has the ability to generate boilerplate test code from rules as well. Usage for test generation from existing rules is simple too:

```bash
usage: generator.py rule [-h] --input_dir INPUT_DIR --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input_dir, -i INPUT_DIR
                        Directory where input files are located.
  --output_dir, -o OUTPUT_DIR
                        Directory where the Python test files will be saved.
```

When we provide the path to the custom rules file we created above, we can generate the test code below:

```python
import unittest

import internal.logtest as lt


# TODO: Rename the class
class CustomRules(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_rule_100000(self) -> None:
        log = r'''TODO: provide a matching log here'''
        response = lt.send_log(log)

        self.assertEqual(response.status, lt.LogtestStatus.RuleMatch)
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_id, '100000')
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_level, 13)
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_description, "Suspicious RDP Redirect Using TSCON")
        self.assertIn('custom', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('windows', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('security', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('windows_security', response.rule_groups)

    def test_rule_100001(self) -> None:
        log = r'''TODO: provide a matching log here'''
        response = lt.send_log(log)

        self.assertEqual(response.status, lt.LogtestStatus.RuleMatch)
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_id, '100001')
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_level, 15)
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_description, "Successful RDP hijack detected")
        self.assertIn('custom', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('windows', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('security', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('windows_security', response.rule_groups)

    def test_rule_100002(self) -> None:
        log = r'''TODO: provide a matching log here'''
        response = lt.send_log(log)

        self.assertEqual(response.status, lt.LogtestStatus.RuleMatch)
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_id, '100002')
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_level, 5)
        self.assertEqual(response.rule_description, "Denied Access To Remote Desktop")
        self.assertIn('custom', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('windows', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('security', response.rule_groups)
        self.assertIn('windows_security', response.rule_groups)
```

The first and the last ones were easy as they included atomic detections. We can just provide the sample logs, and it would suffice. But the second rule was a temporal detection; two rules in a period of time must be triggered for the correlation. For that, we will use the `send_multiple_logs` function and provide 2 logs instead. This way, the regression test will actually be a slimmed-down version of the behavioral test, so it is up to you if you want to use this test or not. Let's fix the test and run it once again.

```python

You can see the tests are passing. At this point, we can be sure no change in the future will break your detections without ringing some bells or flying some red flags.

## Conclusion

Log replay in Wazuh, when combined with the `wazuh-devenv` testing framework, elevates detection engineering from guesswork to a repeatable, code-driven discipline. Helpers like wazuhevtx make short work of converting raw EVTX into Wazuh-ready JSONL, while wazuh-testgen turns complex scenarios into ready-to-run behavioral and regression tests. Together, they let you validate high-fidelity detections against real attack telemetry—just one step shy of full attack simulation—without the operational risk or expense. This workflow keeps your rules sharp, your coverage mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and your changes regression-proof. If you care about maturing your detection pipeline, download these tools, feed them real-world logs, and see how close you can get to adversary emulation before you ever light the match.

[^2]: A [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) is a data structure composed of nodes (in this case, Wazuh rules) connected by one-way edges. "Directed" means that the relationship flows in a single direction, from a parent rule to a more specific child rule. "Acyclic" means there are no loops, ensuring that the analysis process always moves forward and terminates. In Wazuh, this structure allows the analysis engine to efficiently filter events by starting with general rules and navigating down a tree to the most specific match, without having to check every single rule for every log.
[^3]: For this visualization, I used an analysis tool I wrote called simply [rulevis](https://github.com/zbalkan/rulevis). It is in alpha state, but it works!
[^4]: Remember that the rule IDs are unique to the event channel; therefore, the ID numbers by themselves mean nothing. Use the `<Event Channel> <Event Id>` format to be precise.
