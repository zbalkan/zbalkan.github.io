I have shown my blog to my wife, who has worked as both in art and product management, about two years after I created. She hated the design, which was the default template for Jeykll, Minima. She provided great points on UX, readability and accessibility that I had nothing to argue against. At that point, I did not have any other option than to use a different design. This weekend, I migrated the blog to [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), the most popular template. I hope the change provides a better reading experience.
