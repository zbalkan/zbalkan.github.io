# Browser Extensions: A Security Conundrum and the Imperative for Standardized Management APIs

TL;DR: It may not be in your threat model, but browser extensions may present a significant threat depending on the business. Currently the security responsibilities and capabilities are mostly on the browser's extension store. However, IT and security professionals use scanners by creating parsers per each browser's extension model. In order to help improve the ecosystem overall, a standard API which allows extension management in a cross platform and cross browser manner would be a reasonable and feasible approach.

## Historical Context: The Browser Wars and Standardization

The evolution of web browsers has been marked by intense competition, commonly referred to as the "browser wars." Initially dominated by Netscape and Internet Explorer, the landscape has since diversified with the advent of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and others. While this competition has catalyzed technological advancements, it has also led to a fragmented ecosystem where adherence to standards is often compromised. For instance, Internet Explorer's proprietary ActiveX controls and Google's SPDY protocol, which later evolved into HTTP/2, were initially non-standard implementations that posed security risks.

## Security Implications of Browser Extensions

Recent empirical studies, such as the one conducted by Spin.AI, have illuminated the security risks associated with browser extensions. The study, which analyzed approximately 300,000 extensions, found that 51% were categorized as high-risk, capable of capturing sensitive data and executing malicious JavaScript. Furthermore, a significant number of these extensions were authored anonymously, exacerbating the risk profile. These findings are corroborated by specific incidents, such as the malicious ChatGPT extension that compromised thousands of Facebook accounts.

## Current Management Mechanisms: A Fragmented Approach

At present, organizations employ various methods for managing browser extensions, often relying on group policies or vendor-specific solutions. While these approaches offer some control, they are inherently limited by their lack of standardization and are not universally applicable across different browsers and platforms.

## The Proposal: Standardized Management APIs

Given the aforementioned security landscape, there is a compelling case for the development of a standardized API for browser extension management. Such an API would facilitate a unified interaction model, enabling Configuration Management Databases (CMDB), Endpoint Management, Mobile Device Management (MDM), and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems to interface with browsers in a vendor-agnostic manner.

Importantly, this API should extend beyond mere inventory querying, as demonstrated by [existing GitHub projects](https://github.com/zbalkan/scan_browser_extensions). It should encompass a comprehensive set of management functionalities, akin to package managers like `apt` or `yum`, but with additional security-focused features.

## Limitations and Considerations

It's worth noting that not all organizations share the same threat model; thus, the absence of a standardized API may not constitute a significant risk for some. However, the proposal aims to elevate the security maturity of the broader ecosystem and could be integral to the threat models of numerous organizations.

## Conclusion

The history of browser development has been characterized by a tension between innovation and standardization, often at the expense of security. As browser extensions become increasingly integral to user experience and productivity, their potential as attack vectors grows correspondingly. A standardized API for managing browser extensions would not only streamline administrative workflows but also fortify the security posture of organizations. While the endeavor is challenging, given the historical context, it is a necessary step towards a more secure and manageable browser ecosystem.
